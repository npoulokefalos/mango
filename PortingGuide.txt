| Porting & Configuring mango HTTP Client
**************************************************************************************************** */

The OS porting layer is located in mangoPort.c and provides a common interface between the mango code 
and the underlying operating system. Porting mango to new architectures requires only changes to this
file by implementing the defined functions. Proper implementation of the porting layer is critical and 
assures that mango will work as expected.

To adjust the available configuration settings check mangoConfig.h. Options like MANGO_WORKING_BUFFER_SZ 
(defines the size of the working buffer that mango is going to allocate and use per request), MANGO_PRINTF
(the printing function of the system), HTTP timeout values and other settings are located there. 

- For Unix operation define MANGO_OS_ENV__UNIX & MANGO_IP_ENV__UNIX.
- For ChibiOS/LwIP operation define MANGO_OS_ENV__CHIBIOS & MANGO_IP_ENV__LWIP.


To enable/disable the available debugging levels check mangoDebug.h
